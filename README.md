&beta;eta&nbsp;OS
=================

What is &beta;eta&nbsp;OS?
--------------------------
&beta;eta&nbsp;OS is an effort to create an online operating system which doubles as an IDE. It's kind of inspired by [cloud9](http://c9.io/), which already brought cloud-based development one step closer to developers, but &beta;eta&nbsp;OS wants to give developers an optimized user experience by eliminating the need for different tabs or windows outside the development environment that cloud9 is.

Cool! But how far is it?
------------------------
Not that far, really. Basically, the only thing I've got so far is a few sketches about how I think it should look like. I'll upload those later as I get the scanner working. But there's still a lot that has to happen before the project gets off the ground. Things including:

- [x] kickstart the project by working on a prototype
- [ ] document all the features the OS should have
- [ ] in addition, document the aimed user-experience and user-interface
- [ ] create the user-interface using the HTML5-canvas
- [ ] find a way to host it secure and properly
- [ ] create the socket.io API for user-management, logging in, file-streaming, instant messaging and PUSH-messages
- [ ] create a system to develop and run apps
- [ ] ???
- [ ] profit!
