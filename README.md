&beta;eta OS - *the source*
===========================

***What is &beta;eta OS?***
&beta;eta OS, or just &beta;OS for short, is an effort to create an online operating system which doubles as an IDE. It's kind of inspired by [cloud9](http://c9.io/), which already brought cloud-based development one step closer to developers, but &beta;OS wants to give developers an optimized user experience by eliminating the need for different tabs or windows outside the development environment that cloud9 is.
