            <p>So, it appears like you don't have <a href="http://enable-javascript.com/">Javascript enabled</a>, which is kind of a requirement to actually run &beta;eta OS. And, well.... You didn't get this from me, but the easiest way to make sure you can start &beta;eta OS on this PC is by installing the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> browser and re-opening the page in that. So, yeah...
            <p>Anyway, we're sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
